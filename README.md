# Via CEP - XML

This project was created with the intention of demonstrating how to consume CEP's free API - Via CEP.
Noting that it was also created to be used in projects compiled in older Delphi's, which would not have the JSON reading capability.

# Architecture used

The Project created in Pascal with the Delphi compiler uses the interface-oriented architecture.

# Final considerations

I reserve all copyright of the data consumed by the author of the Via CEP API located at the link: https://viacep.com.br
